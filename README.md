Hi. For this project, I've selected the Bellabeat case study, focusing on analyzing user behaviours with their smart health fitness trackers. My goal is to analyse smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. To achieve this, I'll follow a structured data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. This approach will ensure that our findings are not only insightful but also actionable, contributing to Bellabeat's growth in the competitive smart device market.
